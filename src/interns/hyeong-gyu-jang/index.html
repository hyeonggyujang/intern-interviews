      <p>Integration leads to innovation. As I firmly believe in this phrase, I am a person who is deeply interested in
      biological science and its integration to public life. More specifically, my ultimate goal is to become a part of
      a team that develops an application that processes the biological information of a subject, which would eventually
      benefit the subject. In reaching such goal, I am pursuing Master's degree in Applied Computer Science at Grand
      Valley State University (GVSU), also seeking some industry field experiences to solidify my learnings. </p>
      <p>I have particular interest in cloud computing, distributed computing, and computer networking. In all of the three
      field of computing, API communication plays crucial role in exchanging necessary information under specified standard.
      From BluJay Solutions, where I had worked for a year before going to GVSU, I had a privilege to be in a team that
      implemented REST API for internal communication for the first time. From this experience, I have learned how important
      it is to set the initial standard of communication, as I also saw how easily such usage of API could scale.</p>
      <p>From the internship opportunity from Lob, I hope to gain fast-changing field experience along with
      hands-on experience on cutting-edge tools in developing API services once again, but with deeper understandings.
      The internship will not only could expose me to the field experiences and cutting-edge tools, it would also provide
      me a clearer pathway towards my career goal as an application developer in integrated bioscience industry.</p>
